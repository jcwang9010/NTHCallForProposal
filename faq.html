            <li><b>Is this an NIH grant application?</b> No. Solicitation, review, and oversight of awards is managed by the Blueprint MedTech incubator Hubs, 
              <a href="https://www.cimit.org/web/center-for-innovative-neurotech-advancement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CINTA</a> and 
              <a href="https://neurotechharbor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NeuroTech Harbor</a>. 
              Since funding for the Hubs is provided by NIH, the Hubs must comply with the NIH grants policy and flow these policies down to funded projects. These 
              policies include financial management, protection of animal and human subjects, and other reporting requirements. If you are selected for funding, one 
              of the two Hubs will sponsor your project and they will help you navigate these policies.</li>
            <li><b>How can I tell whether my product is mature enough for entry into Blueprint MedTech?</b> In effect, this program does not support basic or 
              applied research (e.g., a typical NIH R01). Your proof-of-concept demonstration should rely upon established scientific or empirical results to the 
              point where no further research is required, aside from a first-in-human demonstration. Please see the GAITS description of 
	      “<a href="https://www.gaits.org/ja/web/medtech/guidance/-/project/milestone/3913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof of concept</a>,” 
              particularly the Technology “Demonstration Results” and “Key Component PoC Prototypes” descriptions for further guidance (www.gaits.org).</li>
            <li><b>Who retains the rights to any intellectual property generated by a proposal?</b> Management of intellectual property will be determined by the 
              institutional policies of the proposing entity.</li>
            <li><b>Should I disclose any unprotected proprietary information in the submission?</b> Protecting proprietary information is the responsibility of the 
              applicant and the applicant institution. Consistent with NIH policy, applicants are discouraged from submitting information considered proprietary 
              unless it is deemed essential for proper evaluation of the application. However, when the application contains information that constitutes trade 
              secrets, or information that is commercial or financial, or information that is confidential or privileged, identify the pages in the application 
              that contain this information by marking those paragraphs or lines with an asterisk (*) at the beginning of the paragraph. Indicate at the beginning 
              of the Research Plan which pages contain asterisks and a note stating: <em>"The following sections marked with an asterisk contain 
              proprietary/privileged information that [name of applicant] requests not be released to persons outside the Government or the Blueprint MedTech 
              incubator Hubs, except for purposes of review and evaluation."</em>  When information in the application constitutes trade secrets or information that 
              is commercial or financial, or information that is confidential or privileged, it is furnished to the Government and the Blueprint MedTech incubator 
              Hubs in confidence with the understanding that the information shall be used or disclosed only for evaluation of this application. If a grant is 
              awarded as a result of or in connection with the submission of this application, the Government shall have the right to use or disclose the information 
              to the extent authorized by law.</li>
            <li><b>Are institutions/organizations/individuals outside of the United States eligible to participate?</b> Foreign institutions, organizations, and 
              individuals based outside of the United States may apply for this funding opportunity. Unfortunately, we can only reimburse up to eight percent of 
              indirect expenses for foreign entities as per 
              <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_16/16.6_allowable_and_unallowable_costs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIH grants policy</a>.</li>
            <li><b>What happens if I miss the deadline for submitting a pre-proposal - can I still submit a full proposal?</b> No. Pre-proposals are required; full 
              proposals are invitation-only.  We anticipate releasing the next Blueprint MedTech incubator hub solicitation in March 2023.</li>
            <li><b>Do you have any accessibility accommodations?</b> Please email 
              <a href="mailto:info@blueprintneurotech.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@blueprintneurotech.org</a> for instructions if your input 
              devices are having trouble with the submission system. No material can be submitted directly to Hub staff.</li>
            <li><b>Who reviews the applications?</b> The Review Panels are made up of practicing clinical specialists, engineers, medical device entrepreneurs, and 
              scientists with broad experience in neurotechnology and medical innovation.</li>
            <li><b>Who should I list as collaborators?</b> List only individuals who are considered key personnel or significant contributors to the work that 
              will be performed, and who have already agreed to their role. Avoid honorific collaborations. For all proposals, the review committee requires that 
              investigators collaborate closely with clinicians and product development experts in the development of the proposal and the conduct of the work. The 
              input of these collaborators must be clearly reflected throughout the application.</li>
            <li><b>I am writing a pre-proposal, may I include several references?</b> You can include as many references as you would like.</li>
            <li><b>Should I submit copies of relevant publications?</b> Please do not submit copies of relevant publications. Standard citation of publications 
              is acceptable.</li>
            <li><b>Are there any budget restrictions or limitations?</b> Capital equipment must be well justified to the purpose and exclusive need of the project. 
              Alterations and renovations will not be supported. Human subjects research will not be supported, except for surveys and in vitro technology validation.</li>
            <li><b>Are indirect costs provided?</b> Indirect costs will be provided at your institution’s Federally-negotiated rate. If your institution does not have a 
              Federally-negotiated rate, indirect costs may be provided up to 10%. Foreign entities may only receive indirect costs up to 8%. Applicants may choose 
              to waive their indirect costs.</li>
            <li><b>When would I receive my funding?</b> No sooner than March, 2023. Your responsiveness to requests for administrative material will directly affect 
              the timeliness of funding. If your proposed work involves human subjects research or vertebrate animal research (including data or tissue derived from 
              humans or animals), the necessary IRB and IACUC approvals must be received prior to award.</li>
            <li><b>What are my reporting responsibilities if I receive an award?</b> An annual report will be required in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
              the award. Quarterly reports will be required to facilitate progress and integration with the overall program. Project teams are expected to attend an 
              annual meeting hosted in either Boston or the Baltimore/Washington region.  Please include reporting and annual meeting expenses in your full 
              proposal’s budget.</li>
